# equivalent-speed-test

equivalent speed test was made for myself to have a concrete entry point into some new languages, as well as compare a standard test across the board to see generally how well everything compares.

the comparison is more about comparing my ability in those languages, for example, my inexperience in C is definitely the factor in why it has such a bad score.

the test is very specific to my future needs:
2d texture multiplications(2.88 billion in total) that can be done in parallel(if the structure supports it), done sequentially. elementwise, not matrix mult.
it sort of emulates the mass multiplications I'll need for my neuro-evolution library
