# equivalent-speed-test

equivalent speed test was made for myself to have a concrete entry point into some new languages, 
as well as compare a standard test across the board to see generally how well everything compares.

the test is very specific to my future needs:
2d texture multiplications(about a billion in total) that can be done in parallel(if the structure supports it), done sequentially.
it sort of emulates the mass multiplications I'll need for my neuro-evolution library
